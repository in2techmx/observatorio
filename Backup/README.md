# Global Gravity Observatory

A sleek, avant-garde news observatory designed to visualize the "Visibility Differential" across global regions.

## Features

- **Split-Screen Pulse & Silence**:
  - **Left (The Noise)**: A "Prism" visualization where news stories are surrounded by floating bubbles representing distinct regional narratives.
  - **Right (The Silence)**: A "Visibility Heatmap" detecting what topics are ignored by specific regions.

- **Antigravity Design**:
  - Floating 3D-like elements using CSS transforms and Framer Motion.
  - Glassmorphism UI for a modern, transparent look.
  - View Transitions for seamless context switching.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd observatorio_site
    ```
2.  Install dependencies (if not already done):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Tech Stack

- **Vite + React**: For a fast, dynamic web application.
- **Framer Motion**: For complex "floating" and layout animations.
- **Tailwind CSS** (via standard CSS variables/utility classes concept implemented in plain CSS/JS).
- **Glassmorphism**: Custom CSS utilities.
